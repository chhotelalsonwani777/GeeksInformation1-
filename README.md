Explore our new online shopping project designed for a hassle-free experience! We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it look cool and easy to use. HTML helps organize the stuff you want to buy, CSS makes it all look nice, and JavaScript adds fun features. Whether you're on your computer or phone, our project works smoothly.
